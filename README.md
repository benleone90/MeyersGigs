MeyersGigs
==========

MeyersGigs is a full stack app with a personality test, information about personality types, and job listings for job titles that are usually compatible with the personality types.  

Users arrive on the home page where they are asked if they are given information about the site and asked if they would like to take the personality test to determine their personality type. The user also has the option to skip right to the results page if they already know their personality type. If they choose to take the test, they sign up via a modal, then are redirected to the survey page. Upon submitting the survey, they are redirected to a results page where their personality type is rendered and described, along with celebrities who share the type, careers that are typically compatible with the type, and job listings for those careers at the location of their choice.
